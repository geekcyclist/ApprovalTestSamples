# ApprovalTestSamples

## Flat-File Customer Data Parser for demonstrating ApprovalTests

The set of projects in this repository are based around a very stripped down flat-file processor. It is meant to highlight some of the advantages of using ApprovalTests.Net to verify complex objects and collection.

The `before` folder holds the core library, and a test project that uses standard xUnit style testing.

The `after` project is meant to demonstrate the finished product after swapping or adding ApprovalTests.

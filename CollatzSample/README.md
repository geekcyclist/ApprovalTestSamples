The set of projects in this repository are based around an "over-engineered" Collatz Series calculator

### The Collatz Conjecture

As found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)
> The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n.  Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half the previous term.  If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the  sequence will always reach 1.

For Example, if you start with the value you end up with the series below:

| Value | Step |
|-------|------|
| 53    | 0    |
| 160   | 1    |
| 80    | 2    |
| 40    | 3    |
| 20    | 4    |
| 10    | 5    |
| 5     | 6    |
| 16    | 7    |
| 8     | 8    |
| 4     | 9    |
| 2     | 10   |
| 1     | 11   |

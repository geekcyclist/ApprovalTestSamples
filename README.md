# ApprovalTestSamples

## Sample projects for demonstrating ApprovalTests

The set of projects in this solution are based around an "over-engineered" Collatz Series calculator.

### The Collatz Conjecture

As found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)
> The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n.  Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half the previous term.  If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the  sequence will always reach 1.
